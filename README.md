Breast Cancer Prediction involves utilizing machine learning algorithms and statistical models to assess the likelihood of an individual developing breast cancer. This predictive analysis typically leverages features such as age, family history, genetic factors, and various health indicators to generate a risk assessment. Machine learning models can be trained on historical data to recognize patterns and associations, enabling them to make predictions about the probability of breast cancer occurrence in a given individual. This proactive approach to prediction aims to aid early detection and improve the effectiveness of preventive measures and interventions for individuals at higher risk of developing breast cancer.
